1.\ Vector Format
=================

Vec1's native vector format is an SQL BLOB containing a packed 
array of 32-bit IEEE floating point values in machine byte order.

<a name=scalar></a>
2.\ Scalar Functions
================

Vec1 provides the following SQL scalar functions:

### `vec1_info()`

This function returns a human-readable string describing the version of
the vec1 extension currently in use.

<a name=l2_distance></a>
### `vec1_l2_distance(VECTOR1, VECTOR2)`

Both arguments must be vectors in <a href=#native>native format</a>. Both must
be the same size. This function returns the square of the euclidean distance
between the two vectors (SQL type real), calculated as:
<pre>
vec1_l2_distance(a, b) = ∑<sub>i</sub>(a<sub>i</sub> - b<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
</pre>

If either argument is not an SQL BLOB, or if the two arguments are of different
sizes, or if the size in bytes of the two arguments is not divisible by 4, an
exception is thrown.

<a name=cos_distance></a>
### `vec1_cos_distance(VECTOR1, VECTOR2)`

Like `vec1_l2_distance()`, except that it returns the cosine distance between
the two vectors (SQL type real), calculated as follows: 
<pre>
vec1_cos_distance(a, b) = 2.0 - ∑<sub>i</sub>(a<sub>i</sub> b<sub>i</sub>) / √((∑<sub>i</sub> a<sub>i</sub>²)(∑<sub>i</sub> b<sub>i</sub>²))
</pre>

This function does not require its arguments to be normalized.  

<a name=to_json></a>
### `vec1_to_json(VECTOR)`

The argument to this function must be a vector in native format. A JSON
array containing the elements of the vector is returned (SQL type TEXT).

### `vec1_from_json(JSON)`

The argument to this function must be a JSON array of numeric values. 
It returns the equivalent vector in native format (a BLOB).

### `vec1_config(PARAMETER)` / `vec1_config(PARAMETER, VALUE)`

The first form returns the current value of parameter PARAMETER (type TEXT).
The second form sets the value of PARAMETER to VALUE, then returns a copy
of the new value. Supported parameters are currently:

<ul>
  <li><b><code>nthread</code></b>. Integer. The number of threads to use for
  various operations, including the main thread. The default value is 1.</li>

  <li><b><code>nprobe</code></b>. Real. The default `nprobe` value to use
  in for queries against vec1 tables. Default value 0.05.</li>
</ul>

#### Example

To configure vec1 to use 16 threads when possible:
```
    SELECT vec1_config('nthread', 16);
```

To query for the current default value of nprobe:
```
    SELECT vec1_config('nprobe');
```

<a name=training></a>
3.\ Training
============

The IVF+OPQ algorithm used by `vec1` requires a trained model.  This model is
built by training on a representative set of vectors (i.e.  vectors with the
same data distribution as those that will be indexed).

There is a single aggregate SQL function used for training:

### `vec1_train(VECTOR, JSON-PARAMETERS)`

The aggregate should be run over the set of training vectors, each vector
passed as the first argument. It returns a BLOB containing the trained model,
which may be used with a vec1 virtual table. The second argument is a JSON
object (type TEXT) containing parameters to configure the model.
The following parameters are supported:

<ul>
  <li><b><code>distance</code></b>. The distance metric to use. Must be either
  "l2" or "cos". The default is "l2".</li>

  <li><b><code>codesize</code></b>. Integer. The size in bytes of the
  product-quantized vectors. Set to 0 to store full (uncompressed) vectors
  in the index.</li>

  <li><b><code>nbucket</code></b>. Integer. The number of buckets used by
  the inverted file (IVF). If set to 0, IVF is disabled and queries perform
  an exhaustive search over all (possibly compressed) vectors.</li>

  <li><b><code>opq</code></b>. Boolean. If true, include an Optimized Product
  Quantization (OPQ) rotation in the model.</li>

  <li><b><code>nopq_round</code></b>. Integer. The number of iterations of
  the OPQ algorithm to use to calculate a rotation, if it is enabled. The 
  default value is 5.

  <li><b><code>residual</code></b>. Boolean. If true and both `nbucket` 
  and `codesize` are greater than 0, then residual instead of full vectors 
  are compressed and stored in the index. The default is true.

  <li><b><code>progress</code></b>. The name of an SQL function registered
  with the database connection. During training, it is invoked periodically
  as if by:
  <pre>
    SELECT progress (:percent, :msg);</pre>
  The first argument (<code>:percent</code>) is an integer indicating the
  approximate percentage of work completed. The second (<code>:msg</code>)
  is a human-readable message describing the current stage in English.</li>

  <li><b><code>nthread</code></b>. Integer. The number of CPU threads to use
  for training, including the main thread. If not specified, the default
  configured via <code>vec1_config()</code> is used. If no default is set,
  training is single-threaded.</li>

  <li><b><code>svd_verify</code></b>. Boolean. If true, additional checks are
  performed on each Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) computed during OPQ
  training. This is computationally expensive and should only be enabled
  when debugging. Default: false.</li>

</ul>

Models may be generated on one machine and used on another. However, the two
machines must use the same byte-order for 32-bit IEEE floating point values.

#### Example

Assume table "learn" contains one training vector per row in column "vec".
The following query generates a model:
```
    -- Returns a model (an SQL BLOB) for use with a vec1 virtual table.
    --
    -- Configuration:
    --   distance = "cos"   -> use cosine distance
    --   codesize = 32      -> compress each vector to 32 bytes
    --   nbucket = 1024     -> use 1024 IVF buckets
    --   opq = true         -> enable OPQ rotation
    --
    SELECT vec1_train(learn.vec, '{
        "distance": "cos",
        "codesize": 32,
        "nbucket": 1024,
        "opq": true
    }')
    FROM learn;
```

4.\ Virtual Table
=================

<a name=vtabcreate></a>
## 4.1. Creation and Population of Tables

To create a `vec1` virtual table:

```
    CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE tbl USING vec1(vector_column, metadata_column...);
```

The first argument specifies the name of the column used to store vectors.
Each subsequent argument specifies the name of a metadata column.

A `vec1` table must contain exactly one vector column, and may contain
between 0 and 255 metadata columns. All `vec1` tables have a unique integer
`rowid` that identifies each row. Additionally, all `vec` tables have a
hidden column named `distance` populated dynamically by nearest-neighbor
queries.

Column names may be enclosed in single or double quotes. If unquoted,
they must consist only of ASCII alphanumeric characters and underscores.
The names "rowid" and "distance" are reserved and may not be used.

It is not possible to specify types or other column constraints for
`vec1` table columns.

`vec1` virtual tables may be modified using standard SQL `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,
and `DELETE` statements. The vector column accepts only BLOB values whose
length is a multiple of 4 bytes (each element is a 32-bit floating-point
value). Once the vector size for a table has been fixed, all inserted vectors
must have exactly that size.

The vector size is fixed when either:

  * The first vector is inserted, or
  * A model generated by `vec1_train()` is applied to the table.

Metadata columns may store values of any type.

<a name=vtabconfig></a>
## 4.2. Configuration

A `vec1` table may be configured to use a model using the following SQL
command:

<pre>
    INSERT INTO tbl(cmd, arg) VALUES('rebuild', MODEL);
</pre>

MODEL must either be a BLOB returned by `vec1_train()`, or else a
JSON object (type TEXT) specifying model parameters. Supported model
parameters for JSON models are:

<ul>
  <li><b><code>distance</code></b>. Text. Must be set to either
  "l2" or "cos" to specify the distance metric to be used by the table.

  <li><b><code>index</code></b>. Text. Must be set to either "none"
  or "flat". A "none" index stores each vector in its own row of an
  SQLite table. The only reason to explicitly configure a "none" index
  is to set the distance metric. A "flat" index stores all vectors in
  large packed SQL BLOBs. This can provide a 2x performance improvement 
  over storing each vector in its own row.
</ul>

The 'rebuild' command automatically rebuilds the index using the new model.
Subsequent 'rebuild' commands replace the existing index. 'rebuild' may be
run before or after vectors are added to the table.

#### Example

To configure a vec1 table to store full vectors in packed BLOBs and to use
cosine distance when queried:

```
    INSERT INTO tbl(cmd, arg) VALUES('rebuild', '{
        index: "flat", 
        distance: "cos"
    }');
```


<a name=vtabquery></a>
## 4.3. Nearest-Neighbor Queries

A `vec1` table is queried for the nearest-neigbours of a vector by using
the table as a table-valued-function, where the first argument is the query
vector, and the second, optional, argument the query parameters. As follows:

<pre>
    SELECT ... FROM tbl(VECTOR, PARAMETERS)
</pre>

If PARAMETERS is passed a TEXT value, it is interpreted as a JSON object
containing query parameters. The following query parameters are supported:

<ul>
  <li><b><code>K</code></b>. Integer. The number of results required.

  <li><b><code>nprobe</code></b>. A real value. This value must be greater
  than 0.0. If a value less than 1.0 is specified, then it is the fraction
  of IVF buckets that should be searched for nearest-neighbors. If the
  value is 1.0 or greater, it is truncated to an integer and used as the
  number of buckets to scan searching for nearest-neighbors. If this 
  parameter is not specified, the connection-wide default configured by
  `vec1_config()` is used. If no default has been configured, 0.05 is used.

  <li><b><code>streaming</code></b>. Boolean. If this parameter is false (the
  default), then `K` and `nprobe` are both hard limits - the virtual table
  will never return more that `K` results or scan more than `nprobe` buckets.
  If `streaming` is set to true, then these parameters are both advisory,
  and the virtual table continues to return results until the SQL engine
  stops requesting them.
</ul>

The hidden `distance` column is populated with the distance between the query
vector and the row vector for each row returned. If the table is configured
with a model that uses compressed vectors (i.e. was trained with a non-zero
`codesize` parameter), then the distances returned in this column are based
on the compressed version of the vector. For non-streaming queries, rows are
always returned in ascending order of this column.

For streaming queries, rows are usually returned in ascending order of
`distance`, but some results may also be returned slightly out of order.
This happens when the SQL engine requests so many rows that the query has
to begin scanning more than the number of buckets suggested by the `nprobe`
parameter.

If PARAMETERS is passed an INTEGER value instead of TEXT, it is equivalent to
specifying the integer as the `K` value and leaving all other query parameters
unset.

<b>WHERE clause processing</b>

If a nearest-neighbor query has a WHERE clause that specifies one or more
constraints connected by AND operators that meet the following criteria, then
they are evaluated internally by vec1. This changes the query results because
this filtering occurs *before* the best `K` results are accumulated. The
criteria are:

<ul>
  <li>  The constraint must use either "IS NULL" or "IS NOT NULL", or else
        one of the binary operators `>`, `<`, `=`, `>=`, `<=` or `IS`, and

  <li>  One side of the operator must be a metadata column of the vec1 table, and

  <li>  the other side is either a constant expression or else an expression
        that may be evaluated using values read only from FROM clause elements 
        that SQLite scans before the vec1 table within the query.
</ul>
 
<b>LIMIT clause processing</b>

Normally, a nearest-neighbor query requires a `K` value to be specified.
However, if a query against a vec1 table as a *visible LIMIT clause*, then
the value passed to the LIMIT clause is used in place of an explicit `K`.
Or, if a query has both an explicit `K` and a *visible LIMIT clause*, then
the smaller of the two values is selected at runtime. Whether or not an
SQL LIMIT clause is visible is determined by the SQL engine. In general,
a LIMIT clause is visible if the query (or sub-query) that uses the vec1
table:

  *  is not a join or an aggregate,
  *  has no ORDER BY clause,
  *  has no WHERE clause, or else a WHERE clause that consists entirely
     of AND connected constraints on metadata columns that vec1 can
     handle internally.
